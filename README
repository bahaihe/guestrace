On DomU (monitoring target):

1. Build and run linux-offset-finder on the Xen DomU guest which you would
like to monitor. See the README and source code in the libvmi source
tree for how to do this.

2. Copy the running kernel's System.map file from /boot to the Xen
Dom0 guest.

3. Restart the Xen DomU guest.

On Dom0 (monitor):

4. Build trace_syscalls and run "trace_syscalls <guest name>" on the
Xen Dom0 guest.

5. Update /etc/libvmi.conf on the Xen Dom0 guest based on the previous
output from linux-offset-finder and the path to the System.map file.
