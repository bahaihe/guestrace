On Linux DomU (monitoring target running Linux):

	1. Build and run libvmi's linux-offset-finder on the Xen DomU
	guest which you would like to monitor. See the README and source
	code in the libvmi source tree for how to do this.

	2. Copy the running kernel's System.map file from the DomU's
	/boot to the Xen Dom0 guest.

On Windows DomU (monitoring target running Windows):

	Run the windows-offset-finder utility on the Xen Dom0 guest
	according to the instructions provided with libvmi.

On Dom0 (monitor):

	1. Update /etc/libvmi.conf on the Xen Dom0 guest based on the
	previous output from {linux,windows}-offset-finder and (for Linux)
	the path to the System.map file.

	2. Add

		GRUB_CMDLINE_XEN_DEFAULT="altp2m=1"

	to /etc/default/grub and add

		altp2mhvm = 1

	to the configuration file which defines each guest.

	3. Restart each Xen DomU guest.

	4. Build guestrace and run "guestrace <guest name>" on the Xen
	Dom0 guest.
